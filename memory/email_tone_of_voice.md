# [User]'s Email Tone of Voice

## Voice Formula
Professional Directness + Genuine Connection + Actionable Value = [User]'s Email Voice

## Core Metrics
- **Formality**: 5/10 (Professional but approachable)
- **Tone**: Confident, warm, direct, helpful
- **Length**: 100-200 words (3-5 short paragraphs)
- **Structure**: Context → Value/Point → Next Step

## Do's
- **Open with specific context**: Reference their work, shared conversation, or relevant detail
- **Get to the point in 2 sentences**: Lead with value—what you're offering, asking, or sharing
- **Use conversational transitions**: "Here's what I'm thinking..." / "Quick thought on this..."
- **Show humanity**: Brief personal touches ("Been thinking about this since our call")
- **Clear next steps**: Make response easy ("Let me know if this resonates")
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max

## Don'ts
- **No corporate jargon**: Skip "circling back," "touching base," "synergy"
- **No hedging**: Avoid "maybe," "perhaps," "just wondering"
- **No walls of text**: If scrolling needed, it's too long

✅ "Quick follow-up on [specific topic]..."
✅ "Been thinking about what you said about..."
