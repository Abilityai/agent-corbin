**Contact:** stephan.polley@trificient-digital.com
**Last Contact:** October 21, 2024 (21 days ago)

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: The "clunky" AI implementation problem you mentioned

Stephan,

Your comment on our call - AI being "clunky when you actually start doing it" - that's exactly what I'm addressing in a webinar on November 18.

Why most AI implementations fail (the clunky problem) and how to identify valuable vs. just "interesting" use cases.

As someone helping SMB clients navigate the "AI buzzword" pressure, this could give you frameworks to better serve your consulting clients.

45 minutes, real case studies, zero vendor speak.

Subject: Following up on our AI implementation discussion

Lewis,

Great connecting earlier this month about AI at Kurogo.

Agencies face a unique challenge - implementing AI internally while helping clients do the same. You need to "walk the talk."

I'm hosting a webinar November 18 on successful AI implementation strategies. Perfect timing for where Kurogo is headed.

45 min executive briefing. Real ROI numbers. Practical frameworks.

### 3. Ian O'Rourke - Adthena Founder ⭐
**Contact:** ianworourke@gmail.com, ian.orourke@adthena.com
**Last Contact:** August 14, 2024 (89 days ago)
**Company:** Adthena (Competitive Intelligence SaaS) - Founder/Board Member

**Why Perfect for Webinar:**
Company is "rethinking products" for AI era. Learned hard lesson: sold "interesting" AI features that churned because they weren't "super valuable." Your webinar directly addresses this.

**Direct Quote:**
> "We're rethinking our own products and what it does for the world... whilst that use case was interesting it wasn't super valuable"

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Ian - "Interesting vs. Valuable" AI implementations

Ian,

Your point about Adthena customers churning when AI was "interesting but not super valuable" really stuck with me.

I'm hosting a webinar November 18 specifically on this - how to avoid the AI implementation trap of building features that seem cool but don't create real value.

Given Adthena is rethinking products for the AI era, the timing is perfect.

Would love to have you join.
