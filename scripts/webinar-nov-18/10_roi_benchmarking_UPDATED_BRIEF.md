# Research Requirement 10: ROI Benchmarking - What "Good" Looks Like for AI Projects
## UPDATED BASED ON WEBINAR PARTICIPANT ANALYSIS (November 15, 2024)

---

## Objective

Research realistic ROI benchmarks for different types of AI implementations. We have specific numbers from AbilityAI case studies (271% ROI, $105K savings, etc.), but we need industry context to position these as exceptional, typical, or conservative.

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Based on participant data, 2 participants explicitly mentioned "measuring impact" as their top challenge, and multiple others implied ROI concerns through "implementation" challenges. This research must provide **practical ROI measurement frameworks for resource-constrained teams**, not just industry benchmarks.
