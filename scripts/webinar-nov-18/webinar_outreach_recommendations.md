## Priority 1: IMMEDIATE ACTION (Next 24 Hours)

### 1. Glenn Klein - Genesis10 President
**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Glenn - The 85% AI failure rate you mentioned (Nov 18 webinar)

Glenn,

You nailed it on our September call when you said "85% of them are failing on those implementations right now."

I'm hosting a strategic briefing on November 18 specifically on this - why companies fail at AI implementation and how to be in the winning 15%.

Given Genesis10's active AI pilot programs and Angie's point about competitors gaining ground, the timing couldn't be better.

It's a 45-minute executive session with real ROI numbers (271% returns, $105K savings we've achieved) and a 90-day readiness framework you can use immediately.

Would love to have you and the Genesis10 leadership team join us.

### 2. Stephan Polley - Trificient Digital CEO
**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Stephan - The "clunky" AI implementation problem you mentioned

Stephan,

Your comment about AI being "clunky when you actually start doing it" really stuck with me.

I'm hosting a webinar November 18 on exactly that - why most AI implementations fail (the clunky problem) and how to identify valuable vs. just "interesting" use cases.

As someone helping SMB clients navigate the "AI buzzword" pressure, this could give you frameworks to better serve your consulting clients.

45 minutes, real case studies, zero vendor speak.

Best,

### 3. Lewis Baxter - Kurogo COO
**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Lewis - Following up on our AI implementation discussion

Lewis,

Great connecting earlier this month about AI at Kurogo.

Agencies face a unique challenge - implementing AI internally while helping clients do the same. You need to "walk the talk."

I'm hosting a webinar November 18 on successful AI implementation strategies. Perfect timing for where Kurogo is headed.
