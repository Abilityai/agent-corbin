## Glenn Klein - Genesis10

**Contact Details:**
- Email: gklein@genesis10.com
- Company: Genesis10
- Role: President
- Location: New York

**Why They'd Be Interested:**
Genesis10 is a $200M IT staffing and consulting company serving Fortune 500 clients (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, PNC Bank). Glenn explicitly stated they are actively piloting AI tools for recruiting and sales automation and want to understand "what do you think you can do for us and how long would it take." They have 40 sales reps, 100-150 recruiters, and are at the strategic decision point of AI implementation.

**Conversation Context:**
- Last Contact: September 18, 2024
- Source: Discovery call transcript + Gmail follow-up (recent)
- Days Since: ~54 days (PERFECT timing)
- Key Topics Discussed:
  - AI adoption strategy for recruiting (15M resumes, manual screening challenges)
  - Sales enablement and automation needs
  - Skepticism about cost-cutting vs. growth narrative
  - Need for AI best practices across distributed teams
  - Competitor advantage concerns: "our primary competitors are busy implementing these tools... we're going to be significantly behind"

**Direct Quotes:**
- "We spent a lot of time over the past month or so discussing strategically how we're going to incorporate AI into what we do"
- Angie Brekke (President Dev10): "I think the other thing... I have every confidence that our primary competitors are busy implementing these tools into their recruitment processes. It's just going to be table stakes. If we don't get there as well, we're going to be significantly behind, seriously disadvantaged."
- Glenn: "85% of them are failing on those implementations right now, because the technology is kind of raw and most of the people don't know what to do with that"

**Personalization Hook:**
"Glenn, after our conversation about Genesis10's AI pilot programs and Angie's point about competitors gaining ground, I thought you'd find this highly relevant. The webinar addresses exactly what you mentioned: why 85% of AI implementations are failing and how companies like yours can be in the winning 15%. Especially timely given your strategic discussions about AI incorporation."

**Timing Recommendation:**
URGENT - Perfect 54-day timing, active pilot programs underway, explicitly seeking guidance

Your network would benefit from this."

Ian is founder of Adthena (competitive intelligence SaaS) and explicitly stated his company is "rethinking our own products and what it does for the world" in the AI era.

  - Rethinking product strategy for AI-first world
  - Concern about building wrong use cases that churn
  - Need for strong customer problem definition vs. interesting features
  - Partnership opportunities in AI space

**Direct Quotes:**
- "We're rethinking our own products and what it does for the world... We're in the process of working out what problems are we going to be solving for customers"
- "What happened is we ended up selling a bunch of customers on these interesting things... after a year most of them would churn out because whilst that use case was interesting it wasn't super valuable"
- "When you take care of a lot of what is the logistical and operational stuff of a business, when you automate that, it does force people to ask new questions about what you might call philosophy and strategy"

**Personalization Hook:**
"Ian, remembering our conversation about Adthena 'rethinking products' for the AI era and your experience with AI implementations that churned because they focused on 'interesting vs. valuable' use cases - this webinar directly addresses how to avoid that trap. It's about strategic AI implementation that creates real value, not just interesting features."

**Timing Recommendation:**
GOOD TIMING - High-value prospect, founder-level strategic thinking, near 90-day mark (due for check-in)

Had intro call and follow-up meeting scheduled (October 11 and October 18, 2024) specifically to discuss AI agent solutions for their agency.

**Timing Recommendation:**
URGENT - Recent discovery conversations, active sales opportunity

**Direct Quotes:**
- "I struggle a little bit finding good use cases for my clients where I can apply AI... you can do things, but then it's a little clunky when you actually start doing it"
- "They don't know. That's the thing. They just want to use AI. That's like the buzzword."
- "It's interesting, because I was looking into that myself... What I was hoping [AI tools] would do is detect the sentiment... and then reply accordingly. But they don't."

**Personalization Hook:**
"Stephan, after our conversation about struggling to find practical AI use cases that aren't 'clunky' for your SMB clients, I immediately thought of you for this webinar. It directly addresses why most AI implementations fail (the 'clunky' problem you mentioned) and how to identify valuable vs. interesting use cases. This could help you better serve your consulting clients."

**Timing Recommendation:**

- Days Since: ~54 days
- Key Topics: Sales enablement, tribal knowledge problems, tool consolidation

- "If we could hear more of what [top performers are] doing... and those things can come over to those middle tier reps to get them from a C plus to a B plus player. That 10% across everybody makes a big difference."

**Personalization Hook:**
"Mark, you mentioned the frustration of sales enablement tools that 'sounded great but didn't really do what they said' - this webinar tackles exactly that: why AI tools fail to deliver and how to spot implementations that actually work. Especially relevant for Genesis10's distributed sales team."

- "The interesting question, right? What is the future of COTS [commercial off-the-shelf software]?"

**Personalization Hook:**
"Angie, your point about competitors implementing AI as 'table stakes' and Genesis10 risking being 'significantly behind' really resonated. This webinar is designed exactly for leaders like you who see the competitive urgency but want to make sure you implement AI right the first time, not join the 85% who fail."

## WEBINAR POSITIONING NOTES

**Key Pain Points to Emphasize** (based on transcript analysis):
1. **85% failure rate** - Explicitly mentioned by Glenn Klein, validates webinar premise
2. **Competitive disadvantage risk** - "Table stakes" urgency from Angie Brekke
3. **"Interesting but not valuable" trap** - Ian O'Rourke's churned customer story
4. **Tool proliferation** - Mark Parisi: "I can't keep bolting 40 different things on"
5. **Clunky implementations** - Stephan Polley's struggle with practical use cases
6. **Cost-cutting vs. growth narrative** - Multiple prospects want growth, not just efficiency

**Success Story Angles**:
- Multi-agent systems replacing disparate tools (Genesis10 pain point)
- Human-in-the-loop implementations that actually work (not "AI will do it all")
- SMB-accessible AI (not just enterprise-scale)
- Vertical-specific implementations (e-commerce, agencies, SaaS)

**Webinar Call-to-Action Ideas**:
- Free AI readiness assessment (30-minute consultation)
- Whiteboarding session offer (mentioned in Genesis10 call as valuable)
- "AI Implementation Playbook" download
- Case study: "How we avoid the 85% failure rate"
