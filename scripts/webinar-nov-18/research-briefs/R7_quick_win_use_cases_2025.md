9. **Which quick-win use cases align with AbilityAI case studies?**
   - Sales automation (BeaverCraft type)
   - Knowledge systems (EV Energy type)
   - Content generation (Holywater type)
   - Process automation (Lead-to-Proposal type)
   - Are these considered "quick wins" or more complex?

10. **What use cases look like quick wins but aren't?**
    - "False quick wins" - seem simple but fail often
    - Why they fail
    - How to avoid these traps

## Priority Data Sources

**High Priority:**
- Gartner quick-win AI use cases 2025
- Forrester rapid-ROI AI implementations
- McKinsey AI use case prioritization research
- MIT Sloan quick-start AI initiatives
- CIO Magazine fast-ROI use cases
- Industry analyst quick-win playbooks

**Use Case Libraries:**
- Consulting firm use case repositories (BCG, Deloitte, etc.)
- Platform vendor use case galleries (validated by third parties)
