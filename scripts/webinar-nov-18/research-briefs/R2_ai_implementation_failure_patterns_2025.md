# Research Brief R2: AI Implementation Failure Patterns (2024-2025)

## Research Objective
Document ACTUAL AI implementation failures from 2024-2025 - what went wrong, why, and what patterns emerge. Ground the "85% failure rate" claim with recent, specific examples.

## Target Timeframe
**2024-2025 data** - focus on failures that have been documented, analyzed, or post-mortemed in the last 12-18 months

## Key Research Questions

1. **What is the current AI implementation failure rate in 2025?**
   - Is the "85% failure" stat still accurate?
   - What do recent studies/surveys show?
   - How is "failure" defined in different studies?

2. **What are the most common reasons for AI implementation failures in 2024-2025?**
   - Technical failures (data quality, model performance, integration)
   - Organizational failures (adoption, change management, governance)
   - Strategic failures (wrong use case, misaligned expectations, ROI shortfall)
   - Resource failures (budget overruns, talent gaps, timeline slips)

3. **What are documented examples of AI implementation failures from 2024-2025?**
   - Public failures (if any - companies rarely publicize)
   - Anonymized case studies from consulting firms
   - Survey data on failure modes
   - Industry-specific failure patterns

4. **What's the difference between "complete failure" and "partial failure"?**
   - Projects abandoned entirely
   - Projects delivering less value than expected
   - Projects with positive ROI but adoption problems
   - "Zombie projects" - technically working but not used

5. **What are the warning signs that predict AI implementation failure?**
   - Early indicators (before launch)
   - Mid-flight red flags (during implementation)
   - Post-launch signals (after deployment)

6. **What's the cost of AI implementation failures in 2025?**
   - Average sunk costs by company size
   - Opportunity costs and strategic setbacks
   - Organizational costs (credibility, morale, appetite for future AI)

7. **How do the "3 strategic gaps" (Vision, Foundation, Adoption) map to actual failures?**
   - Which gap causes most failures?
   - Are there other gaps not in this framework?
   - How do gaps compound each other?

8. **What do companies do after an AI implementation fails?**
   - Abandon AI entirely vs. try again differently
   - Learning from failure approaches
   - Time to retry after failure

## Priority Data Sources

**High Priority:**
- Gartner AI implementation failure analysis 2024-2025
- McKinsey AI survey data on project outcomes
- Forrester AI project retrospectives
- Harvard Business Review AI failure case studies
- MIT Sloan Management Review AI implementation research
- Venture Beat / TechCrunch reporting on AI project challenges

**Medium Priority:**
- Consulting firm anonymized case studies (BCG, Bain, Deloitte)
- CIO Magazine / CIO.com implementation challenges
- Industry-specific failure analysis
- Academic research on AI project outcomes

**Look For:**
- "AI implementation challenges 2025"
- "Why AI projects fail 2024"
- "AI transformation obstacles"
- "GenAI deployment failures"
- "Enterprise AI adoption barriers"

**Avoid:**
- Pre-2024 data (landscape has changed significantly)
- Theoretical risk assessments (want actual failures)
- Vendor success stories (looking for failures, not wins)

## Deliverable Format

Produce a markdown document with:

1. **Executive Summary** (key failure patterns)
   - Current failure rate (if data exists)
   - Top 3-5 failure causes
   - Strategic implications

2. **Failure Rate Analysis**
   - What recent studies show (with sources)
   - How failure is defined
   - Trends from 2024 to 2025

3. **Common Failure Modes** (categorized and ranked)
   - Technical failures
   - Organizational failures
   - Strategic failures
   - Resource failures
   - Each with: description, frequency, examples

4. **Warning Signs and Red Flags**
   - Pre-launch indicators
   - Implementation red flags
   - Post-launch signals
   - Early intervention points

5. **"Three Gaps" Validation**
   - How actual failures map to Vision/Foundation/Adoption gaps
   - Gap prevalence analysis
   - Gaps not covered in framework (if any)

6. **Cost of Failure Analysis**
   - Sunk costs by company size
   - Opportunity and organizational costs
   - Total cost of failure estimates

7. **Case Examples** (3-5 documented failures from 2024-2025)
   - Anonymized where necessary
   - What went wrong and why
   - Lessons learned

8. **Strategic Implications for Webinar**
   - How to position failure prevention
   - Which failure modes your framework addresses
   - Credible warnings backed by recent data

9. **Source List** (all sources with dates and links)

## Why This Research Matters for the Webinar

**For High-Value Participants:**
- **CEO Coaches** need to warn clients about actual failure patterns (not theoretical risks)
- **VCs** need to know what kills AI projects in portfolio companies
- **Enterprise Leaders** need to recognize failure patterns before they happen

**For the Presentation:**
- Validates the "85% failure" opening hook with 2025 data
- Grounds the "3 gaps" framework in actual failure examples
- Provides specific warning signs participants can watch for
- Shows you understand not just success, but failure modes

**Addresses Participant Concerns:**
- "Half-baked implementations" - what causes them, how to avoid
- "Understanding barriers" - actual documented barriers from real failures
- "Where to start" - by understanding what NOT to do

## Success Criteria

Research is successful if it provides:
- ✅ Current AI failure rate data (2024-2025)
- ✅ Top 5-7 failure modes with supporting evidence
- ✅ 3-5 documented failure examples from 2024-2025
- ✅ Warning signs and red flags grounded in real failures
- ✅ Validation (or refinement) of the "3 gaps" framework
- ✅ Cost of failure data to emphasize stakes
