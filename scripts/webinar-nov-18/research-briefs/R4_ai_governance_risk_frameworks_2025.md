# Research Brief R4: AI Governance and Risk Management Frameworks (2025)

## Research Objective
Identify what governance and risk management frameworks leading companies are ACTUALLY adopting for AI in 2025 - not theoretical best practices, but what boards and executives are implementing.

## Target Timeframe
**2025 data only** - governance approaches announced or documented in 2025

## Key Research Questions

1. **What AI governance frameworks are companies adopting in 2025?**
   - NIST AI Risk Management Framework adoption
   - ISO/IEC AI standards adoption
   - Industry-specific frameworks
   - Custom governance models from leading companies

2. **What are boards asking management to put in place for AI governance?**
   - Oversight structures (AI committees, risk boards)
   - Policy requirements
   - Reporting and monitoring
   - Compliance and audit approaches

3. **What are the top AI risks that CEOs and boards are managing in 2025?**
   - Ranked by frequency of concern
   - Data privacy and security risks
   - Bias and fairness risks
   - Regulatory and compliance risks
   - Operational risks (reliability, accuracy)
   - Reputational risks
   - Strategic risks (vendor lock-in, wrong bets)

4. **How are companies structuring AI governance?**
   - Who owns AI governance? (CEO, CTO, CISO, Chief AI Officer, Board Committee)
   - Centralized vs. decentralized governance
   - Cross-functional AI councils
   - Role of legal, compliance, risk management

5. **What AI policies are companies implementing in 2025?**
   - Acceptable use policies
   - Data governance for AI
   - Third-party AI vendor policies
   - Employee AI usage guidelines
   - Customer data protection for AI

6. **How are companies managing AI vendor risk in 2025?**
   - Vendor evaluation criteria
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Data handling and privacy requirements
   - Contract terms and SLAs
   - Exit strategies and lock-in prevention

7. **What's the balance between "move fast" and "manage risk" in 2025?**
   - How are leading companies enabling innovation while managing risk?
   - Pilot vs. production governance approaches
   - Risk appetite by company size and industry

8. **How do the "3 gaps" framework relate to governance and risk?**
   - Does governance address Vision Gap, Foundation Gap, Adoption Gap?
   - Are there governance gaps not covered?

## Priority Data Sources

**High Priority:**
- Gartner AI governance research 2025
- Forrester AI risk management frameworks
- Deloitte AI governance and risk surveys
- KPMG / PwC / EY AI governance guidance
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework adoption data
- Corporate governance publications on AI oversight
- Board director perspectives on AI governance

**Medium Priority:**
- CIO perspectives on AI governance
- CISO perspectives on AI security and risk
- Legal and compliance firm guidance
- Industry-specific governance frameworks (finance, healthcare, etc.)
- Public company AI risk disclosures (10-K, proxy statements)

**Look For:**
- "AI governance framework 2025"
- "Board oversight of AI"
- "AI risk management 2025"
- "AI ethics and compliance"
- "AI vendor risk management"

**Avoid:**
- Pure regulatory/legal analysis (want practical governance, not just compliance)
- Theoretical frameworks without adoption data
- Pre-2024 governance approaches (landscape has changed)

## Deliverable Format

Produce a markdown document with:

1. **Executive Summary** (key findings)
   - What governance approaches are being adopted
   - Top AI risks being managed
   - Balance between innovation and risk management

2. **AI Governance Frameworks in Use** (2025)
   - What frameworks companies are adopting
   - NIST, ISO, custom frameworks
   - Adoption rates and trends

3. **Board-Level AI Governance**
   - What boards are requiring
   - Oversight structures
   - Reporting and monitoring expectations

4. **Top AI Risks Ranked** (by CEO/Board concern level)
   - Each risk with: description, mitigation approaches, examples

5. **AI Governance Structure Models**
   - Who owns AI governance (organizational models)
   - Centralized vs. decentralized
   - Cross-functional councils and committees

6. **AI Policies Being Implemented**
   - Acceptable use policies
   - Data governance
   - Vendor management
   - Employee guidelines
   - Examples from leading companies

7. **AI Vendor Risk Management**
   - Evaluation criteria
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Contract best practices
   - Lock-in prevention strategies

8. **Innovation vs. Risk Balance**
   - How leading companies enable fast movement while managing risk
   - Pilot vs. production governance
   - Risk appetite patterns

9. **"Three Gaps" and Governance Linkage**
   - How governance addresses Vision, Foundation, Adoption gaps
   - Governance gaps not covered in framework

10. **Strategic Implications for Webinar**
    - How to position governance in the "readiness" conversation
    - What governance signals executive maturity
    - When to address governance (early vs. later)

11. **Source List** (all sources with dates and links)

## Why This Research Matters for the Webinar

**For High-Value Participants:**
- **CEO Coaches** need to guide clients on board expectations for AI governance
- **VCs** need to ensure portfolio companies have appropriate governance
- **Enterprise Leaders** need to benchmark their governance against peers
- **Board Members** need to understand what oversight is expected

**For the Presentation:**
- Addresses the "are we ready?" question strategically
- Provides governance frameworks participants can adopt
- Shows you understand risk management, not just opportunity
- Positions AI implementation as a governed, strategic initiative

**Addresses Participant Concerns:**
- "Framing AI initiatives" - governance provides the framing
- "Cultural change" - governance enables structured change
- "Regulation of company's policy in use of AI" - direct answer

## Success Criteria

Research is successful if it provides:
- ✅ 3-5 governance frameworks being adopted in 2025
- ✅ Top 5-7 AI risks ranked by board/CEO concern
- ✅ Practical governance structure models
- ✅ Example policies companies are implementing
