# Webinar Research Briefs Overview
## 8 Focused Deep Researches for November 18, 2024 Webinar

**Created:** November 15, 2024
**Purpose:** Strategic research for "Why Most Companies Fail to Implement AI Right" webinar
**Research Method:** Gemini Deep Research (web-based, factual, 2025 data only)
**Target Audience:** CEOs, C-suite executives, VCs, CEO coaches, enterprise leaders

---

## Research Philosophy

**Strategic + Grounded:** These researches provide strategic insights for high-value participants (CEO coaches, VCs, enterprise leaders) while staying grounded in factual, recent data.

**2025 Data Only:** All research focuses on 2025 sources - things are moving fast in AI, and older data isn't relevant.

**Web-Searchable:** Each research is designed for Gemini Deep Research to find answers through comprehensive web searches of analyst reports, surveys, case studies, and executive perspectives.

**MECE Synthesis:** The data will be synthesized later using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles to create a coherent, actionable framework.
