## Priority Data Sources

**High Priority:**
- Gartner market guides for AI platforms 2025
- Forrester Wave reports (AI platforms, AI services)
- IDC AI market analysis and vendor assessment
- McKinsey / BCG on build vs. buy decisions
- CIO perspectives on AI vendor selection
- G2, Gartner Peer Insights (platform reviews and ratings)

**Market Intelligence:**
- AI platform vendor landscape maps
- Market share data for AI tools
- Pricing benchmarks for platforms and services
- Integration and implementation partner ecosystems

**Decision Frameworks:**
- Build vs. buy decision matrices
- Total cost of ownership analyses
- Risk-benefit frameworks

**Avoid:**
- Vendor marketing materials (biased)
- Single-vendor case studies
- Overly technical platform comparisons (want strategic decision guidance)

## Why This Research Matters for the Webinar

**For High-Value Participants:**
- **CEO Coaches** need to guide clients on build/buy/partner decisions
- **VCs** need to evaluate whether portfolio companies are making smart decisions
- **Enterprise Leaders** need to make this decision themselves

**For the Presentation:**
- Addresses a critical strategic decision: "Should we build or buy?"
- Positions custom development (like AbilityAI approach) against platforms
- Helps participants understand viable paths forward
- Provides market context and vendor landscape

**Addresses Participant Concerns:**
- "Where to start" - which path is right for you?
- Resource constraints - what's achievable with limited budgets?
- "Use it properly" - which approach leads to success?

**Strategic Positioning:**
- You build custom systems (BeaverCraft, EV Energy, etc.)
- When does custom make sense vs. platforms?
- How to position your expertise: custom when it matters, platform when it works
