# Research Requirement 9: Executive Decision-Making - What CEOs Are Actually Asking About AI
## UPDATED BASED ON WEBINAR PARTICIPANT ANALYSIS (November 15, 2024)

---

## Objective

Research what questions and concerns C-level executives are expressing about AI in 2024. **CRITICAL UPDATE:** Based on actual webinar participant data (41 registrants), we know this audience is primarily struggling with **implementation and getting started** (39%), **cutting through hype** (20%), and **team adoption** (15%). This research must address these specific pain points.
