If you're running marketing for a B2B company, you know the content treadmill. You record a webinar, give a presentation, do a podcast interview—and then what? Someone has to manually turn that into LinkedIn posts, tweet threads, newsletter content, Instagram carousels. And if you want custom images? That's a whole separate project with designers.

So what happens? Either you burn out your marketing team doing all this manual reformatting, or you just... don't post most of your content. You're sitting on dozens of great recordings that never make it to social because nobody has time to package them up.

We built a system that does all of this automatically. You drop a video transcript into a folder, and seven to ten minutes later, you've got LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, Instagram carousels with custom-designed images, newsletter content, PDF carousels—all formatted for each platform, all in your brand voice, all ready to review and publish.

And here's what makes it actually work: it's not just reformatting your content. It's pulling out the key insights, adapting the tone for each platform, generating professional carousel designs that follow your brand guidelines, and maintaining your authentic voice across everything.

What this means for your marketing team: you go from spending two to three hours manually creating platform-specific content to spending fifteen minutes—five minutes recording your thoughts, ten minutes reviewing what the system generated and scheduling it. That's a ninety percent time savings.

Your content volume goes up because there's no friction anymore. You can finally use all those conference talks, internal presentations, and expert interviews sitting in your drive. And you get consistency—same brand voice, same visual style, same quality across every platform, every time.

Let me show you what this looks like end to end, from transcript to published content across all your channels...
