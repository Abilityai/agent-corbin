## Script

**[0:00 - 0:25] The Problem**

"If you're running a business—especially as a founder or solo executive—you know the juggling act. You're constantly switching between Gmail, Calendar, your CRM, task lists, trying to remember who you talked to last month about what, digging through old emails to find that one conversation, manually scheduling meetings, and somehow keeping track of everything happening across multiple projects.

And here's the brutal part: the higher-level work you actually need to do? Strategy, partnerships, key decisions? That's getting squeezed into the cracks because you're drowning in operational busy work."

**[0:25 - 0:55] The Solution**

"So I built Corbin—think of it as an AI chief of staff that lives inside Claude Code. It's connected to all your business systems: Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive, your CRM, your contact database, even your meeting transcripts.

It doesn't just answer questions—it actually takes action. Need to schedule a meeting? Done. Want to know what you discussed with someone six months ago? It searches your email history and call transcripts. Need to prep for a meeting? It pulls up everything about the attendees from your enriched contact database—their LinkedIn activity, company info, past conversations. It can even draft emails, manage your tasks, and keep your CRM updated."

**[0:55 - 1:20] Business Impact**

"What this means for your business: you get hours back every day. No more context switching between ten different tools—just ask Corbin in plain English. Your CRM actually stays updated because Corbin handles it. You walk into every meeting prepared because it automatically briefs you on who you're meeting with.

And here's what people don't expect: it learns your business over time. It remembers your preferences, your past decisions, your relationships. It becomes genuinely useful because it has the full context of how you work, not just access to your tools."

**[1:20 - 1:30] Demo Transition**

"Let me show you what this looks like in practice. We'll walk through a typical morning workflow..."

## Closing Message

"This is what's possible when you give AI real access to your business systems and the right context. It's not about replacing you—it's about giving you back the time to do the work that actually matters. And it gets better the more you use it because it's learning your business, not just executing commands."
