So if you're running an e-commerce business or a SaaS company, you know the drill with customer support. Your team is drowning in tickets—people asking the same questions over and over. 'Is my charger compatible?' 'How do I set this up?' 'Am I eligible for this program?'

And here's the thing: most of these questions? They follow patterns. But your support team is manually answering each one, checking eligibility rules, looking up compatibility charts, writing responses from scratch.

So we built a system that handles this automatically. It reads incoming support tickets, figures out what the customer is actually asking about, pulls the relevant information from your knowledge base or your systems, and either drafts a response for your team to review or—if it's confident enough—sends it directly.

For the more complex stuff, it gives your support agents exactly what they need: the customer's history, relevant help articles, suggested responses. Basically turns every agent into your best agent.

What does this mean for your business? First, you're handling way more tickets with the same team—we've seen 20 to 35% cost reduction. Your response times drop because the system is working 24/7. And here's the part people don't think about: your agents stop burning out on repetitive questions and can actually focus on the cases that need a human touch.

Plus, you get really clean data on what's actually breaking in your product or confusing your customers, which feeds right back into your product team.

Let me show you how this actually works. We'll walk through a real example from one of our e-commerce clients...
