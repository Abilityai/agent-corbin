## Script

**[0:00 - 0:25] The Problem**

"If you're running a coaching business or any kind of structured program—whether it's health coaching, business consulting, professional development—you've hit this ceiling, right? You can only work with so many clients personally. And the stuff that makes your program work—the personal attention, the accountability, the 'I remember what you told me last week'—that's what takes all your time.

So you're stuck: either you limit your income by limiting clients, or you hire more coaches and try to clone yourself, which never quite works the way you want."

**[0:25 - 0:55] The Solution**

"What we built is basically an AI version of your coaching methodology. It delivers your exact program—the frameworks, the questions, the check-ins, everything—but it can do it for 10 clients or 1,000 clients at the same time.

And here's the key: it's not just spitting out generic responses. It remembers everything about each client. What they said in week one, what they're struggling with, what their goals are. It adapts the pacing based on how they're actually doing. If someone's crushing it, it moves them forward. If they're stuck, it adjusts."

**[0:55 - 1:20] Business Impact**

"What this means is you can finally scale your expertise without diluting the quality. Your clients get 24/7 support—they're never waiting until your next call to get unstuck. And you're not spending hours on the repetitive stuff: check-ins, accountability messages, answering the same questions.

The coaches we've worked with go from serving 20-30 clients max to easily handling 100+, while their completion rates actually go up because nobody falls through the cracks anymore."

**[1:20 - 1:30] Demo Transition**

"Let me show you what this looks like from a client's perspective, and then what you see on the backend..."
