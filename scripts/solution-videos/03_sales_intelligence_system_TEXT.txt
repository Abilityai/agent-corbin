If you're running a B2B sales team, you know your reps spend half their time on stuff that's not actually selling. They're researching prospects before calls, trying to remember what was discussed last time, updating the CRM, looking for the right case study to send, following up on things they forgot about.

And here's what kills you: every rep does this differently. Your top performer has their system, everyone else is winging it. So you get inconsistent pipeline data, missed follow-ups, and a lot of 'I forgot to update that opportunity.'

So we built a system that basically acts like a personal assistant for each sales rep. Before every call, it sends them a brief: here's what you talked about last time, here's what's new with this account, here's the relevant talking points.

After calls, it can pull key points from the recording and update your CRM automatically. It watches for when follow-ups are due and reminds reps. When someone needs a case study or proof point, it finds the right one based on the prospect's industry and situation. And if your prospect list gets thin, it can go find more contacts that match your ICP.

What this does for your business: your reps get 4 to 6 hours back every week—time they can spend actually talking to prospects. Your CRM data finally becomes trustworthy because it's getting updated consistently. Your pipeline forecasts actually mean something.

And here's the part sales leaders love: you can see what's actually working. Which messages get responses, which case studies close deals, where reps are getting stuck. Not because you're micromanaging, but because the data is just... there.

Let me walk you through what this looks like from a rep's day-to-day perspective...
