## EMAIL 1: Brandi Dugal
**To:** brandi@thefidgetgame.com, brandidugal@gmail.com
**Subject:** that content thing we talked about

Hey Brandi,

I recently published a demo of that content automation system and thought you might be interested to see it: https://youtu.be/eAXk4U3uqOY

Basically shows how I take one video and turn it into posts for all platforms in about 10 minutes. Built it for myself but figured it could work for product businesses too.

Also doing a webinar on Tuesday (Nov 18) about why AI projects fail - free for C-levels if you're interested: https://www.ability.ai/webinar_why_most_companies_fail_to_implement_ai

Let me know what you think.
